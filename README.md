#ðŸ“¦ AdventureWorks Data Engineering Project on Azure
This project is a comprehensive Data Engineering practice pipeline built using Microsoft Azure services and the AdventureWorks dataset. It simulates a real-world enterprise data flow, leveraging modern data engineering principles such as the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and distributed data processing with PySpark.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Data Source:
Extracted data from an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server (msSQL) database using Azure Data Factory (ADF) with an integration runtime gateway for secure access.

ETL Pipeline:

Extract: Data extracted via ADF pipelines from various AdventureWorks tables.

Transform: Used Azure Databricks (PySpark) to clean, normalize, and join data across multiple entities.
Followed best practices like partitioning and schema enforcement.

Load: Transformed data was written into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) and modeled using Azure Synapse Analytics.

Medallion Architecture Implementation:
Applied a multi-layer architecture to structure the data flow:

Bronze Layer: Raw ingested data from source systems.

Silver Layer: Cleaned and joined data with business logic.

Gold Layer: Aggregated and analytics-ready data for reporting and dashboards.

Data Modeling & Access:
Created external tables and views in Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying and downstream consumption by BI tools (e.g., Power BI).
